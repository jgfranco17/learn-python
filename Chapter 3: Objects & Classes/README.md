## Object-Oriented Programming in Python

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Python. We will begin by learning about classes and objects, and how they can be used to represent real-world entities. We will then delve into encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are key concepts of object-oriented programming.

Object-oriented programming is a powerful paradigm for building complex applications in Python. Classes and objects are used to represent real-world entities, while encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism help in writing maintainable, reusable, and flexible code. By mastering these concepts, you will be able to write object-oriented programs that are easy to read, maintain, and extend.
