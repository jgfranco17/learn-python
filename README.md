<h1 align="center">Let's Learn Python!</h1>

---

<p>
As a self-taught programmer myself, I developed this project to provide a comprehensive and accessible introduction to Python for beginners. These lessons will cover the basic essential concepts and skills needed to get started with programming in Python, including:

* Basic syntax and data types
* Control structures and loops
* Functions and modules
* Working with data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and sets
* Object-oriented programming
* Debugging and error handling

The lessons are provided as a combination of text notes and independent exercises, allowing learners to practice and apply their knowledge as they progress through the course. My goal is to provide a clear and engaging learning experience that will help students build a strong foundation in Python and feel confident in their ability to use the language.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Python is a popular, powerful, and versatile programming language that is widely used in a variety of industries and applications. It is a great language to learn for beginners, as it is easy to read and understand, and has a large and active community of users who can offer support and resources.

One of the main reasons Python is so popular as a starting language is because it is very easy to learn and use. It has a simple syntax that is easy to read and understand, even for those who have no prior programming experience. This makes it a great choice for beginners who are just starting to learn programming.

Additionally, Python is very versatile and can be used for a wide range of tasks. It is commonly used in web development, data analysis, scientific computing, and many other fields. This means that learning Python can open up a lot of career opportunities and allow you to work on a diverse set of projects.

Finally, Python is constantly evolving and improving. It has a large and active developer community that is always working on new features and libraries, which means that there is always something new to learn and explore. This makes Python a great language to learn for those who enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the tech industry.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
