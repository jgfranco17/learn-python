## Variables & Data Types

In Python, a variable is a named location in memory that is used to store and manipulate data. Variables are used to store values such as numbers, strings, and complex data types, and can be declared and assigned values using the assignment operator (=).

For example, here is how you would declare and assign values to variables in Python:

```python
x = 5  # x is an integer variable with a value of 5
name = "John"  # name is a string variable with a value of "John"
```
Python has several built-in data types, including:

* **Integers**: These are whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, etc. They can be positive, negative, or zero, and can be stored using the int data type.

* **Floating-point numbers**: These are numbers with decimal points, such as 3.14, 0.5, etc. They can also be positive, negative, or zero, and are stored using the float data type.

* **Strings**: These are sequences of characters, such as "hello" or "goodbye". They can be represented using either single quotes or double quotes, and are stored using the str data type.

* **Booleans**: These are special values that can only be either True or False. They are often used to represent the outcome of a condition or comparison, and are stored using the bool data type.

In addition to these built-in data types, Python also allows you to define your own data types using classes. We will discuss this in more detail in a later chapter.

It is important to choose the appropriate data type for your variables, as this can affect how they are stored and manipulated in your programs. For example, you cannot perform arithmetic operations with strings, but you can with numbers. We will cover how to work with these data types in more detail in the following sections.
