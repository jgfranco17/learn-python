Chapter 1 - Exercise 2

Let's step it up a notch! This exercise will combine the topics you have 
learned and make you use the topics together.

Write a Python program that does the following:
- Defines a variable 'x' that is equal to 5.
- Defines a variable 'y' that is equal to 10.
- Defines a variable 'z' that is equal to x + y.
- Defines a function 'add()' that takes two arguments and returns the sum of the arguments.
- Defines a function 'power()' that takes two arguments and returns the result of raising the first argument to the power of the second argument.

Notes:
- You may use any built-in Python functions and methods that are relevant to the assignment.
- You must not use any external libraries or modules in your solution.
- Your solution must be well-documented and include appropriate comments.

# Check the output of the functions
