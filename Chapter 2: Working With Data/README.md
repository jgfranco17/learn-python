# Working with Data in Python

The second chapter of the lessons covers working with data in Python. This includes topics such as:

* A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Python provides several built-in data structures that allow you to store and manipulate data in different ways. Some of the most commonly used data structures in Python are:

    * Lists: Lists are ordered collections of items that can contain any type of data. They are declared using square brackets and are indexed by position. You will learn how to create lists, access and modify their elements, and perform common operations such as sorting and searching.

    * Dictionaries: Dictionaries are unordered collections of items that are stored as key-value pairs. They are declared using curly braces and are indexed by keys. You will learn how to create dictionaries, access and modify their elements, and use them to store data in a more organized way.

    * Sets: Sets are unordered collections of items that do not allow duplicates. They are declared using curly braces and do not have an index. You will learn how to create sets, add and remove elements, and perform common operations such as union and intersection.

    * Tuples: Tuples are immutable sequences of values that can contain a variety of data types. They are similar to lists, but cannot be modified once created. Tuples are often used to store data that should not be modified, such as constants.

* Reading and writing files: You will learn how to read and write data from and to files in Python. This will allow you to store and retrieve data from external sources, and will also introduce you to file handling concepts such as modes, file pointers, and exceptions.

* Parsing and manipulating strings: You will learn how to manipulate strings in Python using string methods and formatting techniques. This will allow you to extract and modify data stored in string form, and will also introduce you to the concept of regular expressions, which are used to match patterns in strings.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of how to work with data in Python, and will be able to use these skills to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in your programs.
